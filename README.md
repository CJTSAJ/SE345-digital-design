# SE345-digital-design

## Introduction
This is a repo which contains projects of the course **Digital Logic Design of Computer Components** (SE345) in SJTU in year 2017-2018.

## Contents
- `my_first_fpga`: A demo project provided by Altera to help you get familiar with FPGA/verilog designing process.
- `stopwatch`: A stopwatch. For more details see [experiment report](./stopwatch/stopwatch_report.pdf).
- `sc_computer`: A single-cycle CPU. A [truth table](./sc_computer/Truth_Table_to_student.xlsx) is provided and fulfilled. For more details see [experiment report](./sc_computer/sc_computer_report.pdf).
- `pipe_computer`: A pipelined CPU. For more details see [experiment report](./pipe_computer/pipe_computer_report.pdf).
- `exp_exam`: Solution to the experiment exam. For more details see [here](../../tree/master/exp_exam).
- `number_game`: A number game based on the FPGA board. This is a freely-chosen extension project. For more details see [experiment report](./number_game/number_game_report.pdf).
- An [experiment manual](./软件学院2015级数字部件设计课程实验指导书_v0.8.pdf) provided by our instructor.
